AirGap Wallet offer support for dark mode in its wallet. Dark mode is a popular feature among users, as it provides a darker color scheme for the user interface, which can be easier on the eyes and more comfortable to use in low-light environments.

## Benefits of dark mode

One of the main benefits of dark mode is that it can reduce eye strain and fatigue, which can be especially important for users who spend long periods of time using the wallet. By reducing the amount of bright light emitted from the screen, dark mode can help users feel more comfortable and reduce the risk of eye strain and other related problems.

In addition to the benefits for user health, dark mode can also help to conserve battery life on mobile devices, as it requires less energy to display dark colors than bright colors. This can be especially important for users who rely on their mobile devices to access the wallet throughout the day, as it can help to extend the battery life of their devices and reduce the need for frequent charging.

Overall, the support of dark mode in AirGap's wallet is an important feature that provides a more comfortable and efficient user experience. By offering this feature, AirGap is able to meet the needs of its users and ensure that they have the best possible experience when using the wallet.
