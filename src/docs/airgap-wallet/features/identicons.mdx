Creating transactions and verifying addresses can be challenging due to the numerous characters and lack of clear patterns. To simplify this process, AirGap has integrated a useful tool called identicons which enables users to verify at a glance.
Don Park introduced the concept of "identicons" in 2007, as a way to visually represent data that is typically displayed as numbers or strings on the web. There are numerous identicon formats with different styles to explore, as listed [here](https://github.com/drhus/awesome-identicons)

## Identicons format in AirGap

AirGap has incorporated identicons created based on the user's address or the fingerprint of the recovery phrase. Two types of identicons are currently in use in AirGap.

### Blockies

For the accounts we use the so-called [Blockies](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/vanity-blockie-miner-for-ethereum-902fccf0a427). These are used in AirGap Wallet as well as in AirGap Vault. Blockies get created by using the user's crypto address as an input.

### Lifehash

For the secret (only on AirGap Vault) we use the [Lifehash](https://lifehash.info/) identicons. Please note that the lifehash identicon is only available in the Advanced mode and is not shown by default. The Lifehash identicons are generated by the fingerprint of the recovery phrase and use this data to then create a unique visual representation. Note that hashes (eg. the fingerprint of the recovery phrase) can not be used to reverse-engineer the original input.

## Some of the benefits of identicons in AirGap

### Blockies identicons for simplification

Imagine you have a wallet with a seed phrase like "dwarf waste sudden direct tilt dumb penalty shoot quantum arrange coil panic clutch mixed surge hello solar mimic erode trim hotel mother bar vacuum." This phrase can generate multiple wallets. Identicons can help distinguish between them through their visual representation. For example, you can create multiple wallets for work and personal use, and each wallet is assigned a unique identicon. This way, you can easily identify which account you are using without having to read the address. Identicons offer a simple and intuitive way to visually differentiate between multiple accounts, making it easier to manage and organize them. Blockies Identicons is one such tool that simplifies the management of multiple wallets.

### Use Lifehash Identicons for authentication

Instead of using the address for this authentication, another feature of the identicons in AirGap Vault are the lifehash identicons for each secret. This feature is only available when the advanced mode is enabled (AirGap Vault > Settings > Advanced Mode > Advance). With this feature, the lifehash of the fingerprint of the recovery phrase is displayed on the secret card. This also serves the same purpose of authenticating the address using the identicons for the address.

### Verification

Another great feature of the identicon in AirGap is its uniform display across all three devices involved in a transaction: the vault, the sender, and the receiver. The receiver address is displayed identically on each device, making it easy for users to verify that they are sending their funds to the correct address.

The use of identicons eliminates the need for users to rely solely on text-based information for verification purposes. Instead, they can quickly and easily identify the receiver's address through the unique image associated with it. This enhances the overall user experience and adds an extra layer of security to the transaction process.

For example, if a user mistakenly entered the wrong address, the identicon associated with that address would not match the one they were expecting to see. This discrepancy would immediately alert the user to the error, allowing them to take the necessary steps to rectify the situation before the transaction is completed.
