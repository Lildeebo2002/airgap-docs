[WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.org/) is an open-source protocol for connecting decentralized applications to mobile/hardware Wallets utilizing end-to-end encryption and scanning of a QR code. WalletConnect is a new feature that we've added as part of our strategy to make it possible to interact with as many ERC20 tokens as possible within the wallet while maintaining the highest level of security possible.

## How to use WalletConnect in AirGap

In this example, we will access uniswap and connect AirGap to it. You'll need both the Vault and Wallet apps, as well as another device to access the uniswap website, so make sure you have both (preferably a desktop browser).

:::note Difference in interface
There may be some differences between the screenshots you see here and those you see on other websites (DApps). The buttons may be located in a different area of the page or they may be referred to by a different name altogether. They will, however, almost always follow the same procedure to perform a transaction.
Also, Be careful when visiting a website (DApp). Make certain you are only visiting the official app.
:::

- Start by opening your desktop browser and then visiting this website: [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) Uniswap's official website should be accessed by clicking on this link.
