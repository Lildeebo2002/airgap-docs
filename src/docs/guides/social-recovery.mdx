:::note
The process of generating your social recovery shares is using an algorithm called [Shamir's Secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) Sharing. This algorithm allows you to combine any of the shares to get back to your original secret while giving contacts with fewer than the required number of shares NO information about your original secret. This is, in contrast, to simply cutting your original secret into multiple pieces and giving it to your contacts. If you do that, you reveal a part of your secret to each one, leaving you vulnerable to brute force attacks. This is not the case if you use our social recovery generation.
