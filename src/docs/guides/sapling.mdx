## What is Sapling

Sapling or shielded transactions allows you to perform privacy-preserving transactions of fungible tokens in a decentralized environment. It was an original idea from the Electric Coin Company, the company behind the ZCash protocol and it has long been the gold standard for transaction protection in blockchain, whereby the confidentiality of the sums and the unlinkability of the sender and receiver are protected. This feature was recently added to the Tezos network.

## What are the use cases for Sapling

- True privacy: Due to cryptocurrency's pseudonymous nature most people believe it provides privacy for payments but in reality, it does not. In fact, crypto gives less protection than fiat monetary authorities in certain ways, since it is a public blockchain that can theoretically reveal the real identity behind a public address if someone has enough resources to do chain analysis. With the introduction of sapling, transactions can now be routed through a shielded pool thereby providing true privacy and anonymity.

## How to use Sapling in AirGap

:::caution Screenshots
The screenshots in this tutorial were taken on a testnet called "Edonet", but the flow is exactly the same on ghostnet and mainnet. You do not have to change your network if you are using this guide in the future for mainnet.
:::

First, make sure you have AirGap Vault set up with a secret.

Click "Fund Account" to fund your shielded XTZ account from your unshielded XTZ account.

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/sapling/16-shielded-tez-fund.png"} />

Then select any unshielded Tezos account to pay the fee for the funding operation.

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/sapling/17-shielded-tez-prepare.png"} />

On this page, we are creating a shielded transaction to a random shielded account.
Specify amount, address and click "Create Transaction"

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/sapling/23-shielded-to-shielded-tx-vault.png"} />

Sign the transaction

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/sapling/24-shielded-wrapping-tx.png"} />

:::note Wrapped
Every shielded transaction has to be "wrapped" by a regular tezos transaction to pay the network fees. This is why there are some extra steps and you have to sign 2 transactions. First, you need to sign the "shielded transaction", then you have to choose which account to "wrap" it to pay the fee in tez. The account that wraps the shielded transaction is public, but the transaction details of the shielded transaction are private.
:::

Selected your unshielded account to wrap the transaction.

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/sapling/25-shielded-wrapping-tx-vault.png"} />

Sign transaction again.

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/sapling/26-shielded-wrapping-tx-broadcast.png"} />

Confirm the transaction.

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/sapling/27-shielded-detail.png"} />

This transaction is shielded. Nobody can see how much you sent or to whom.

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/sapling/28-unshield-prepare.png"} />

On this page, we want to unshield the remaining 10 XTZ tokens. Click the Send button, Specify amount, paste any unshielded XTZ account address and click "Create Transaction".
