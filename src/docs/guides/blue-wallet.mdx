Watch-only wallets allow you to keep track of your cold wallet (for example, AirGap Vault) without accessing your private key. Import your extended public key to watch your balance and initiate transactions.

In this guide, we walk you through how to set up a watch-only wallet with BlueWallet and AirGap Vault.

### How to set up a watch-only wallet

- [AirGap Vault - Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.airgap.vault)
