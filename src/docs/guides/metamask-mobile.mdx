In this guide, we will explore how you can set up MetaMask mobile as a watch-only wallet with AirGap Vault.

MetaMask mobile is a non-custodial wallet that brings the experience of MetaMask extension to your mobile device for accessing all EVM-compatible blockchains.

If you already have MetaMask mobile installed and set up, you can skip the next step and proceed to pair MetaMask with AirGap Vault.

:::note Other EVM network
In this guide, we used the ETH Network as an example and BNB network for creating a transaction, but the AirGap Vault is blockchain agnostic. It can sign transactions on any EVM chain by adding the RPC of that chain to MetaMask. Nothing needs to be done on the Vault, besides the steps listed below.
We've tested it for Avalanche, Polygon, Celo, FUSE network, Moonriver, Moonbeam, and Astar.
