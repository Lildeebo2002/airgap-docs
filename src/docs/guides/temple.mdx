:::caution Hot üî• Wallet
Temple is a hot wallet, and we do not recommend that you import a recovery phrase from a hot wallet into AirGap. A recovery phrase from a hot wallet has been exposed to a network, which defeats the purpose of having a cold wallet like AirGsp.
For best practice, [set up a new wallet in AirGap](https://support.airgap.it/guides/step-by-step-guide) and send your funds to the address of that wallet.
