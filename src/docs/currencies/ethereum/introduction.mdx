## Introduction to Ethereum

Ethereum goes beyond peer-to-peer payment. It is a global, open-source environment for decentralized applications.

Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, Ethereum is the world's leading programmable blockchain.
Ether is the native currency of Ethereum (ETH). Many of the properties of ETH are similar to those of Bitcoin. It is entirely digital and can be instantly sent to anyone, anywhere in the world. [Learn more](https://ethereum.org/).
